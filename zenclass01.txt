1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Ans: HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications. 
More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 
For instance, when someone navigates to cloudflare.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an 
HTTP request to the Cloudflare servers for the content that appears on the page. Then, Cloudflare servers
send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of 
development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, 
HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster 
is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Ans: Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

myCar.model = 'Altros';

myCar.year = 1978;

myCar.wheels = 2;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

myCar.year

Output: 1978

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

myCar.year

Output: 1978
